## Project Notes

I had a really hard time trying to get a javascript lightbox working and i wasent able to complete it.

I thought the javascript lightbox was just a simple lighting effect so i saved it for last thinking it was easy to implement 
but when i started working on it i struggled for hours and was forced to leave it out because it was breaking my website. Im really 
struggling in all my classes so i dident have as much time as i would have liked to try and figure it out.
