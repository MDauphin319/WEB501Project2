# Next NHL Season

The NHL's 2019-20 regular season will commence Wednesday, Oct. 2, with a four-game slate, highlighted by the St. Louis Blues raising their first Stanley Cup championship banner before facing the Washington Capitals at Enterprise Center. The 1,271-game regular-season schedule - 82 games per team - will conclude Saturday, April 4, 2020.

The other three games on the first night of the 2019-20 season include the Ottawa Senators visiting the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena; the Edmonton Oilers hosting the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Place; and the Vegas Golden Knights playing host to the San Jose Sharks at T-Mobile Arena.

The Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks are both celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2019-20. The Sabres open their season in Buffalo at KeyBank Center on Oct. 5 versus the New Jersey Devils. The Canucks will play their home opener at Rogers Arena against the Los Angeles Kings on Oct. 9, exactly 49 years after the franchise's first NHL regular-season game, also against the Kings (Los Angeles 3, Vancouver 1 on Oct. 9, 1970).
